        <p>
          Throughout history, humanity has sought to understand the
          mysteries of the universe. From ancient stargazers mapping
          constellations to modern scientists exploring the far reaches
          of space, the pursuit of knowledge has been an essential part
          of our journey. In this lesson, we'll explore how our
          understanding of space and time has evolved, and how it
          continues to shape the world around us.
